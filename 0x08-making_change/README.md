# 0x08. Making Change

## Overview

This repository contains a solution for the "Making Change" problem, where the objective is to determine the fewest number of coins needed to make a specific amount of money using given denominations.

## Problem Statement

Given an amount of money and an array of coin denominations, the goal is to compute the minimum number of coins required to make that amount.

## Example

**Input:**
- Amount: 27
- Coins: [1, 5, 10, 25]

**Output:**
- Minimum coins needed: 4 (one 25-cent coin, one 1-cent coin, and one 1-cent coin)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd making-change
```

## Usage

1. Call the function with the amount and coin denominations:
   ```python
   make_change(amount, coins)
   ```
2. The function returns the minimum number of coins required.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a straightforward solution to the "Making Change" problem, demonstrating basic algorithmic principles in a practical scenario. For detailed implementation and examples, refer to the source code within the repository.
